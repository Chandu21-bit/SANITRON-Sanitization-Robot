# SANITRON - Sanitization Robot for Train Compartments

## 📅 Duration
March 2024 – July 2024

## 🧠 Summary
This project proposes the development of a sanitization robot designed to tackle the health risks associated with disease transmission in crowded train compartments. The robot, named **SANITRON**, autonomously navigates using ultrasonic and passive infrared sensors for obstacle detection. An Arduino microcontroller manages its operations, and motor drivers regulate the application of sanitizer.

Feedback mechanisms help adjust the robot’s speed and direction in response to obstacles, ensuring effective sanitization without manual intervention.

## 🎯 Goal
To improve cleanliness in train compartments, ensuring passenger safety by reducing the risk of disease transmission using automation.
